# A Minimalistic compiler


The project implements a basic compiler by applying syntax-directed translation. ARM assembly language is used as the target. The compiler is implemented using Coco/R which is a compiler generator and generates a recursive descent parser and scanner given an ATG(Attributed Translation Grammer), symbol table and a code generator.


Implementing functionalities such as:
1.Scalar and non scalar variables
1.conditional statements: switch cases and ternary operators
1.parameter passing 



Here is a detailed report of my implementation:
